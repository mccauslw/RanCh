Description: This package provides tools for a research project whose purpose is to help us
    better understand the foundations of stochastic discrete choice. It includes datasets
    compiled from the literature on context effects and stochastic intransitivity and from
    some recent experiments. It provides graphical tools to display likelihood function and
    posterior density contours, as well as regions, in the space of choice probabilities,
    defined by various stochastic choice axioms, context effects and other conditions.
